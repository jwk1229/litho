/**
 * A class that is annotated with this annotation will be used to create a component that renders
 * something, in the form of either a Drawable or a View.
 * <p>A class that is annotated with {@link MountSpec} must implement a method with the
 * {@link OnCreateMountContent} annotation. It may also implement methods with the following
 * annotations:
 * - {@link OnLoadStyle}
 * - {@link OnEvent}
 * - {@link OnPrepare}
 * - {@link OnMeasure}
 * - {@link OnBoundsDefined}
 * - {@link OnMount}
 * - {@link OnBind}
 * - {@link OnUnbind}
 * - {@link OnUnmount}
 * <p>If you wish to create a component that is a composition of other components, then use
 * {@link LayoutSpec} instead.
 * <p>For example:
 * <code>
 *
 * {@literal @}MountSpec
 * public class MyComponentSpec {
 *
 *   {@literal @}OnCreateMountContent
 *   MyDrawable onCreateMountContent(ComponentContext c) {
 *     return new MyDrawable(c);
 *   }
 *
 *   {@literal @}OnMount
 *   void onMount(
 *       ComponentContext context,
 *       MyDrawable myDrawable,
 *       {@literal @}Prop MyProp prop) {
 *     myDrawable.setMyProp(prop);
 *   }
 * }
